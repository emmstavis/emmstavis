Hi!

My name is Emma Stavis, and I am a Junior studying Computer Science and Political Science at Swarthmore College. 

Posted are a sample of projects I did in the summer of 2022. I am unable to make several projects from the summer and school year publically viewable, so please reach out to me directly if that code is of interest.
